### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Some of my humble OSS contributions:
- (Apache Airflow Hashicorp Vault provider) https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/51991
- (Hashicorp Terraform Google provider) https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/pull/6675
- (Docker Sbt Scala) https://github.com/sbt/docker-sbt/pull/99
- (Apache Beam) https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/13083

Always wondering how things work around me, do my homework to understand it good enough to be able to abstract around it.

My programming language journey: C, C++, SQL, Java, C#, Python, Scala, Scripting (bash, Hocon, jq, yq, HCL). 

Have fun! ðŸŒ»
